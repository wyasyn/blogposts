# 5 Essential Tips for Building Accessible Websites

When designing and developing websites, it's crucial to prioritize accessibility to ensure that all users, regardless of their abilities, can access and use your content. Here are five essential tips for building accessible websites:

<br />
<br />

## 1. Use Semantic HTML

We recommend using **Semantic HTML** to structure your website's content in a way that is meaningful to assistive technologies like screen readers. This means using appropriate HTML elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to organize your content.

<br />

## 2. Ensure Keyboard Accessibility

Another essential tip is to ensure **Keyboard Accessibility**. Users who cannot use a mouse rely on keyboard navigation to browse the web. Make sure all interactive elements on your site, such as links, buttons, and form inputs, are easily accessible and operable using only the keyboard.

<br />

## 3. Maintain Color Contrast

**Color Contrast** is crucial for users with visual impairments. Ensure there is sufficient contrast between text and background colors to make content readable for everyone. Tools like WebAIM's Contrast Checker can help you evaluate and improve color contrast on your website.

<br />

## 4. Provide Descriptive Alt Text for Images

Include **Descriptive Alt Text** for all images to provide context and information to users who cannot see them. Screen readers read alt text aloud, so it should accurately describe the content or function of the image.

<br />

## 5. Test with Accessibility Tools

Finally, **Testing with Accessibility Tools** is essential to identify and fix accessibility issues on your website. Use tools like Axe, Lighthouse, or WAVE to perform accessibility audits and address any issues before deploying your site.

By following these five essential tips, you can ensure that your website is accessible to all users, regardless of their abilities or disabilities.
