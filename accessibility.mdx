# 5 Essential Tips for Building Accessible Websites

When designing and developing websites, it's crucial to prioritize accessibility to ensure that all users, regardless of their abilities, can access and use your content. Here are five essential tips for building accessible websites:

<br />
<br />

## 1. Use Semantic HTML

We recommend using **Semantic HTML** to structure your website's content in a way that is meaningful to assistive technologies like screen readers. This means using appropriate HTML elements like `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, and `<footer>` to organize your content.

<br />

### Example

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
    <head>
        <meta charset="UTF-8" />
        <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
        <title>Accessible Web Page</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <header>
            <h1>Accessible Web Page</h1>
            <nav>
                <ul>
                    <li><a href="#section1">Section 1</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#section2">Section 2</a></li>
                    <li><a href="#section3">Section 3</a></li>
                </ul>
            </nav>
        </header>

        <main>
            <section id="section1">
                <h2>Section 1: Introduction</h2>
                <p>This is the introduction section.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="section2">
                <h2>Section 2: Content</h2>
                <p>This is the main content section.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="section3">
                <h2>Section 3: Conclusion</h2>
                <p>This is the conclusion section.</p>
            </section>
        </main>

        <footer>
            <p>&copy; 2024 Your Website</p>
        </footer>
    </body>
</html>
```

## 2. Ensure Keyboard Accessibility Another essential tip is to ensure

**Keyboard Accessibility**. Users who cannot use a mouse rely on keyboard
navigation to browse the web. Make sure all interactive elements on your site,
such as links, buttons, and form inputs, are easily accessible and operable
using only the keyboard.

<br />

## 3. Maintain Color Contrast **Color Contrast** is crucial for users with

visual impairments. Ensure there is sufficient contrast between text and
background colors to make content readable for everyone. Tools like WebAIM's
Contrast Checker can help you evaluate and improve color contrast on your
website.

<br />

## 4. Provide Descriptive Alt Text for Images Include **Descriptive Alt Text**

For all images to provide context and information to users who cannot see them.
Screen readers read alt text aloud, so it should accurately describe the content
or function of the image.

<br />

## 5. Test with Accessibility Tools Finally.

**Testing with Accessibility Tools** is essential to identify and fix accessibility issues on your website. Use tools like Axe, Lighthouse, or WAVE to perform accessibility audits and
address any issues before deploying your site. By following these five essential
tips, you can ensure that your website is accessible to all users, regardless of
their abilities or disabilities.
